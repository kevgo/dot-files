  this hows all the functions that could be provided as that parameter)

  so that it implements the interface provided as a parameter

#### Compile YouCompleteMe

```
$ compile_youcompleteme
```


#### Fugitive

- show Git status view: `Gstatus`
- stage/unstage entire files: in the status view, go to the file and press `-`

stage hunks:
- open a file that contains changes: hit `[enter]` in the status view
- close NERDtree
- run `:Gdiff` inside this file
  - left side is the index file
  - right side is the working copy
  - run `:diffget` or type `do` (diff obtain) while the cursor is inside a change 
    to pull the entire hunk from the other side into this region
  - run `:diffput` or type `dp` to push the current hunk to the other side
  - if lines are selected, `:diffget` and `:diffput` work only on those lines
    
- run `:diffupdate` to refresh the view


undo all changes in a file
- open file
- run `:Gdiff`
- run `:Gwrite` from the index file to write the index to the working copy
- 

commit:
- hit `[shift]-C` in the status window or run `:Gcommit`


when resolving merge conflicts:

```
:GitAdd
```
